Hello, if you're Mrs. Krasteva and using some anti-plagarism checker, this is me, Richard Yi, and I 
uploaded my code to this site for version control.

If you're not Mrs. Krasteva, I have no idea how you could have gotten here.
There's not much here except for couple hundred lines of code in a nearly extinct language.
